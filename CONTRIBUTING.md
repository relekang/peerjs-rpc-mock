## I have never written bailey before
Don't worry, just write Javascript. I will add the bailey version after merging.
**Just make sure you do not run `make`,** because it will overwrite your Javascript.
If you want to check it out the documentation for bailey is on [haeric.github.io/bailey.js](http://haeric.github.io/bailey.js/).
